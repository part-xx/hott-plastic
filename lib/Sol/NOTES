DISCUSSION ON HOW TO REPRESENT.
 * opt for representing in-language version, and using theorems to lift it.
    * name c_X is the condition,
    * name p_X is the proof of it.
	* name f_X is DP-level version of it.

NB this could be an interesting case for coercions?  

or not possible, since meta meta?
