what other classes would be useful? 

PRINCIPLE - name control - get the std functions via this abstraction

ie, just one leq, with implicit param...

can infer new dictionaries by lifting dictionaries over structures.
(eg Ord A -> Ord (List A))

this could also be a good way to organise the generalisation - esp with
proofs?
